# Your friend, Kant D. Bugg, is learning how to use dictionaries. Kant wants to use a dictionary to keep track of all his Halloween candy - he has several different types of candy, and wants to keep a count of each type. Unfortunately, his script has some bugs in it. Help Kant find the bugs and get his script running!

# Each time you run the code, read the error messages in the console. Each message will tell you which line to look for a bug, and even give you a hint about what the bug is.

# After you find and fix the bug, run the code again. Read the new error message and find the next bug, until the program runs fully!

# If you can't remember how to fix a certain line of code, look at one of your past projects for an example.


# I have 15 Snickers, 7 Almond Joys, 6 Twix, 9 Kit Kats, 3 Reese's Cups, and 2 Butterfingers
candies = dictionary("Snickers"(15), "Almond Joy"(7), "Twix"(6), "Kit Kat"(9), "Reese's Cups"(3), "Butterfingers"(2))

# Print how many I have of each type of candy
print("A count of each of my candies:")
for candy in candies:
  numCandy = candies[i]
  print(candy + ": " + str(numCandy))


# Oops, I forgot that I ate one of each kind of candy. I need to subtract one from each count!
for candy in candies:
  candy = candy - 1


# I traded all of my Twixes to my friend for 4 Junior Mints
candies["Twix"] = 0
candies["Junior Mints"] = candies["Junior Mints"] + 4

print()
print("An updated count of each of my candies:")
for candy in candies:
  numCandy = candies[i]
  print(candy + ": " + str(numCandy))

# Bonus: Calculate and print out the total pieces of candy I now own
