# STRINGS AND VARIABLES

############################################

# What is a variable? Store the string “animal” in a variable called word. Store the number 42 in a variable called num. 
word = "animal"
num = 42

# Print one of the variables
print(word)

# What type of data is stored in num? Can you turn it into a string?
  # Answer: integer (number ok as well)
str(num)

# Ask the user to guess an animal, and then to guess the color of that animal.
animal = input("Guess a type of animal: ")
color = input("Guess what color the animal is: ")

# Print the number of letters in the animal the user guessed (so that it works no matter what animal the user chose!)
print(len(animal))

# Print only the third letter in the color that the user guessed
print(color[2])

# Print a statement that tells the user what animal and color they guessed (make sure there’s a space between the color and animal!)
print("You guessed a " + color + " " + animal)

# Write a comment describing what the line you wrote for number 7 does
  # ex: This tells the user what color and animal they guessed, by using the color and animal variables we got from the user input above, and adding it to a string that says "You guessed a "

# LOOPS

#############################################

# What is a loop? What do we use it for?
  # ex: We use it when we want to repeat some code over and over / when we want to do something multiple times!

# What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop? 
  # ex: We use a for loop when we want to repeat a certain number of times, and a while loop if we want to repeat until a condition is met

# Print the numbers 0 to 10 using a for loop
for i in range(0,11):
  print(i)

# Print each individual letter of the color from the user input above, using a for loop
for i in range(0,len(color)):
  print(color[i])

# Print every third number from 6 to 15 using a for loop
for i in range(6,16,3):
  print(i)

# Using a while loop, print the numbers 0 to 15
x = 0
while x < 16:
  print(x)
  x+=1

# Using a while loop, print every other letter of the animal that the user inputted, starting from the second letter.
i = 1
while i < len(animal):
  print(animal[i])
  i += 2

# Bonus Question: Print the numbers 1 to 10 using a while True loop
x = 1
while True:
  print(x)
  x+=1
  if x == 11:
    break

# CONDITIONALS

###########################################

# What is a conditional statement is? Can you think of an example of a conditional in real life?
  # ex: An if-then statement; where we check if something is true; tells program to do something only if the condition is true..etc
  # ex: If it's raining, I take an umbrella; if the light is red, then stop, etc

# Using the guesses that we asked the user for above, we want to check if the user guessed correctly! First things first, let’s just check if they guessed a cat. If the animal they guessed was a cat, tell the user “we love cats!”
if animal == "cat":
  print("we love cats!")

# Next, let’s tell the user whether they got the right answer of a black dog! Print “Correct answer!” if the animal is a black dog, print “Almost there!” if the animal is either black or a dog, and print “Incorrect answer :( ” if the user guessed neither.

if animal == "dog" and color == "black":
  print ("Correct answer!")
elif animal == "dog" or color == "black":
    print("Almost there!")
else: 
  print ("Incorrect answer :(")

#  Do you remember what a nested if statement is? How would you change part of the above problem to include a nested if statement?
if animal == "dog":
  if color == "black":
      print ("You're right!")
  else:
    print ("You have the right animal! Try a different color")
else: 
  print("Incorrect answer :(")
